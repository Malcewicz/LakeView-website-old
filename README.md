Welcome to my first real website!

Yes, if you look closely it is made from a template, but come on, i still did a fair share!
It's not like nobody ever used a template for anything, right?

Anyway, the website is in polish, so if you were going to check it out and you don't know the language, i guess you can still just look around.

Thanks for coming here, although i have no idea how you found a small dev like me :)

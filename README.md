# LakeView Przewiez OLD

This website was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript / jQuery.
Also using a free template with skel for responsive design

The website is in polish, so if you were going to check it out and you don't know the language, i guess you could still just look around?

## !DEPRECATED!

The website was deprecated because of its slow load times and poor performance. I wrote the new site myself from scratch, because I felt the template was just terrible and it turns out I was right. The new website works a lot better, loads really fast and the package is way smaller.

You can check out the new website's repository [here.](https://github.com/Malcewicz/malcewicz.github.io)
